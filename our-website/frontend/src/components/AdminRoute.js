/*
children in React - 
In React, the term "children" refers to the components, elements, or content that are passed as the child elements between the opening and closing tags of a React component.
The 'AdminRoute' component is designed to be a wrapper around other components or content.
The content that you want to conditionally render for admin users is passed as the 'children' prop.


Example of how you might use this AdminRoute component:

<AdminRoute>
  <AdminDashboard />      // children
</AdminRoute>

In this example, <AdminDashboard /> is the content that you want to be rendered conditionally for admin users.
It is passed as the 'children' prop to the 'AdminRoute' component.

So, when the 'userInfo' indicates that the user is an admin, the 'children' (in this case, <AdminDashboard />)
will be rendered. If the user is not an admin, the code redirects the user to the "/signin" route.
